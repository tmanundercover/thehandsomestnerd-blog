// This file was made using the aboved linked tutorial
// This is to share type script type declarations and code accross front and backend
//declaration: Generates a declaration file that the frontend and backend apps can use to reference items in the common app.
//composite: Ensures TypeScript can quickly determine where to find the outputs of the referenced project
//declarationMap: Enables editor features like “Go to Definition” and Rename to transparently navigate and edit code across project boundaries in supported editors
